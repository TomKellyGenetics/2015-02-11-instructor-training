#Schedule

*Instructors:* [Bill Mills](https://twitter.com/billdoesphysics), [Damien Irving](https://twitter.com/drclimate)  
*Lesson notes:* There is an "in progess" version of the instructor training lesson notes [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/)

##Day 0 - Pre-reading

Participants are asked to familiarise themselves with the materials for one of the following major Software Carpentry (SWC) lessons: 
* [Unix shell]()
* [Programming with Python](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/python/index.html)
* Programming with R (link to come)
* [Programming with MATLAB](http://swcarpentry.github.io/matlab-novice-inflammation/)
* [Version control with Git](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/git/index.html)
* [Using databases and SQL](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/sql/index.html)

A number of the activities during the course involve teaching short segments of these lessons, so participants are advised to pick the one that they would like to teach. They don't need to know the material by heart - they just need to have read through from start to finish and understand the general topics and concepts covered.

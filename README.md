## Certification

At the conclusion of a 3-day instructor training course, participants are required to have done three things in order to be officially certified:  

1. Submit a (small) proposed change/improvement to the repository of Software Carpentry teaching materials on GitHub
2. Create a workshop website (this can be a fake or one that is actually used in future)
3. Teach a short lesson to Greg Wilson

Everyone will do (2) and (3) on the final day of the instructor training. Weâ€™ll also set up a video link on the second day of the instructor training so that people can do (3) if they feel ready.

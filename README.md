## Advertising & registration

Details of the event and instructions about registering can be found at this [FAQ page](http://resbaz.tumblr.com/instructor-training).  

To avoid confusion, the advertising simply pitches a "Software Carpentry instructor training course." There might be a small number of participants who aren't looking to be involved with Software Carpentry (e.g. computer aided design people), however we can contact those people individually and explain. 

## Planning meetings

Notes from our online planning meetings are being kept at [this Etherpad](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/train-the-trainer-resbaz).  

## Certification & ResBaz conference participation

During the training course all participants will have a go (in small groups) at teaching a small section (10-15 min) of the Software Carpentry teaching materials to each other. Those participants who are feeling particularly confident will then have the option of teaching that same section at the Research Bazaar conference during the following week. Participants who do this will be certified at the conclusion of the conference. All other participants will be encouraged to attend the conference as a helper (if they are relatively comfortable with the teaching content) or participant (if they need to up-skill and learn some of the content), with a view to teaching at a bootcamp in the future. Upon teaching at a future bootcamp (under the guidance and assistance of more experienced instructors, of course) those participants will be officially certified.

There may be a small number of participants who wish to instruct for a program other than Software Carpentry. For those people Mozilla Science Lab will figure out a badging system.

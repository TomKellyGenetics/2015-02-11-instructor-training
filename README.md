## Advertising & registration

Details of the event and instructions about registering can be found at this [FAQ page](http://resbaz.tumblr.com/instructor-training).  

To avoid confusion, the advertising simply pitches a "Software Carpentry instructor training course." There might be a small number of participants who aren't looking to be involved with Software Carpentry (e.g. computer aided design people), however we can contact those people individually and explain. 

## Lesson notes

Greg Wilson and Bill Mills are writing their lesson notes [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/) (source code [here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/instructor-training)), and Bill Mills is putting together an [instructor training website](http://mozillascience.github.io/instructorTraining/).
  
## Certification

At the conclusion of a 3-day instructor training course, participants are required to do three things in order to be officially certified:  

1. Submit a (small) proposed change/improvement to the repository of Software Carpentry teaching materials on GitHub
2. Create a workshop website (this can be a fake or one that is actually used in future)
3. Teach a short lesson to Greg Wilson

Everyone will do (2) on the final day of the instructor training, whereby they will get in groups and create the website for the workshop they are going to run in 2015. We’ll also set up a video link on the final day of the instructor training so that people can do (3) if they feel ready. For step (1), we’re going to run a 1-hour GitHub sprint on the Wednesday morning of the conference. After two days of teaching/helping/participating everyone will have identified some small changes they’d like to make to the teaching materials, so we’ll have our global network of topic maintainers online to provide immediate feedback.

There may be a small number of participants who wish to instruct for a program other than Software Carpentry. For those people Mozilla Science Lab will figure out a badging system.

## Introduction to the Software Carpentry GitHub repo

* The coolest thing that Software Carpentry is doing might actually be our collaborative lesson development
  * Education doesn't have a patch and merge culture like software development.
  * Can you imagine a Physics Carpentry? Or a Biology Carpentry? It would be awesome. 
  * In computational science education we have a chance to do it right because we don't have entrenched traditions
* The [bc repo](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc) is now frozen
* All the new repos follow the [lesson template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template)
* You can see the whole list of repos [here](https://github.com/swcarpentry)
  or find the link from the [lessons page](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html)

## Software Carpentry workshops in Aus/NZ, 2015

This document will be used to guide the final session of the instructor training course, which requires the participants to get together in geographical groups and plan workshops for 2015 (including the construction of a draft website). The document includes not only the names of the instructor trainees, but also of people who have contacted Damien Irving over the last few months expressing an interest in helping out at a workshop (Damien has the contact details for all these people).

### Brisbane

Due to the large cohort of instructors, there is scope to run a number of workshops in Brisbane in 2015. We should probably have Belinda Weaver from [QCIF](http://www.qcif.edu.au/) Skype in for this session, as she is a great supporter of Software Carpentry and can source helpers and funding.

### Melbourne (Swinburne)

Arna Karick is looking to establish a Swinburne Data Science Institute in 2015, so it might be good to get her to attend this session.

### New South Wales

Due to the large cohort of instructors, there is scope to run a number of workshops in New South Wales (Sydney and Canberra in particular) in 2015. [Intersect](http://www.intersect.org.au/) runs eResearch training at pretty much all the tertiary research institutions in New South Wales, so they are a natural fit to coordinate (and perhaps provide funding for) many of these workshops (Luc Small and Stuart Allen from Intersect are attending the instructor training). 
* Instructors: Luc Small, Stuart Allen, Joshua Madin, Fabian Held, Nic Hannah, Jack Simpson
* Possible helpers: Iraklis Konstantopoulos, Mark Cowley
* Website/s:
* Notes: There are already a number of very active instructors in Sydney, including Diego Barneche, Daniel Falster and Rich FitzJohn 

### New Zealand eScience infrastructure

The New Zealand eScience infrastructure sponsored a number of people to come to the instructor training, with a view to coordinating a number of workshops across New Zealand in 2015. They can all get together during this session and plan how this will play out.
* Instructors: Nick Jones, John Rugis, Sina Masoud-Ansari, Sung Bae, Mik Black, Cameron McLean, Tom Kelly, James Boocock, Richard Hosking, Constantine Zakkaroff, Prashant Gupta

## Software Carpentry workshops in Aus/NZ, 2015

This document will be used to guide the final session of the instructor training course, which requires the participants to get together in geographical groups and plan workshops for 2015 (including the construction of a draft website). The document includes not only the names of the instructor trainees, but also of people who have contacted Damien Irving over the last few months expressing an interest in helping out at a workshop (Damien has the contact details for all these people).

## History of Software Carpentry in Aus/NZ

### What is Software Carpentry?

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) is a volunteer organization whose 
members teach basic software skills to researchers in science, engineering, and medicine. 
It was founded in 1998, but really came to prominence in 2012 
when it shifted to a teaching model centred around intensive two-day 
[workshops](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/).
Today:
* Almost 300 workshops have been held around the world 
  (check out the [map](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/previous.html)), 
* There are around 170 active instructors 
  (i.e. who have taught in the past 2 years; see [map](http://software-carpentry.org/pages/team.html))
* We just passed 10,000 learners

[This paper](http://f1000research.com/articles/3-62/v1) documents the history of the 
organisation.

##### Australia and New Zealand

In early February 2013, Damien Irving and Joshua Madin pooled their funds and got 
Greg Wilson (Founder and Executive Director of Software Carpentry) out to Australia to run
a workshop for Genes to Geoscience at Macquarie University and the AMOS conference in Melbourne.
Those were the first ever workshops outside of North America and Europe.

Since that initial spark of activity there's been another 15 workshops in Aus/NZ and 
there's a dozen active instructors.

### What gets taught at a workshop?

A workshop is an on-site workshop, 
typically two days long, 
that covers the core skills needed to be productive in a small research team:
* the Unix shell (and how to automate repetitive tasks);
* Python, R or MATLAB (and how to grow a program in a modular, testable way);
* Git and GitHub (and how to track and share work efficiently); and
* SQL (and the difference between structured and unstructured data).

The task automation (e.g., how to write a simple shell script), 
modular programming (particularly how and why to break a program into functions), and
version control bits are compulsory if you want to call yourself a Software Carpentry workshop.
 
The format is short tutorials that alternate with hands-on practical exercises.
There is a high tutor to student ratio and learners work on their own laptops 
so that they have a working environment when the workshop is done. 

### Governance, partners and relatives

In order to keep up with its rapid growth, 
Software Carpentry recently transitioned from a benevolent dictatorship to a full blown
democracy with a volunteer Steering Committee (dedicated volunteers) and 
Advisory Council (representatives from Partner and Affiliate organisations).

The only paid position is the Executive Director 
(mainly through workshop fees and contributions from Partners and Affiliates), 
which means essentially all the work 
(i.e. governance, lesson development, teaching, workshop coordination, website) 
is done by volunteers (and to a smaller extent staff from Partners and Affiliates). 

##### Partners/affiliates

The University of Melbourne is an official Affiliate. 
As part of that arrangement we have an obligation to help Software Carpentry grow right 
across Australia, 
not just at the university. 
NeSI is thinking of forming a similar relationship with Software Carpentry and helped 
us bring a whole bunch of New Zealanders over.

##### Data Carpentry

The huge popularity of Software Carpentry has also meant that a sister organisation,
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/), has also recently started up. 
In a nutshell, Software Carpentry is for people who have already done a little programming
but want to know how to do it properly,
while Data Carpentry is for people who have never programmed 
(and it's also more discipline specific).

### Instructor training

People who are looking to become Software Carpentry instructors
usually already have more than enough technical knowledge. 
What they tend not to have is a working knowledge of the latest research and 
thinking in education/teaching. 
The course therefore focuses on educational psychology, 
teaching techniques and instructional design, 
and how these topics can be applied in helping researchers learn to code
(see the curriculum [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/curriculum/)).

We started out running training courses via an online, 14-week, 2-3 hours per week course
(and those still run every couple of months),
but have found like with the workshops, 
face-to-face teaching over 2-3 intensive days works better.
